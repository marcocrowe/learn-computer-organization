## Question 24

**CPU and Memory**: Explain the fetch-decode-execute cycle of a CPU.

### Question 24 Answer

The fetch-decode-execute cycle is the fundamental process by which a CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes instructions in a computer system. The cycle consists of the following steps:

1. Fetch: The CPU fetches the next instruction from memory using the program counter (PC) to determine the memory address of the instruction.
2. Decode: The CPU decodes the fetched instruction to determine the operation to be performed and the operands involved.
3. Execute: The CPU executes the decoded instruction by performing the specified operation on the operands, updating the program counter, and storing the result in memory or a register.
4. Repeat: The CPU repeats the fetch-decode-execute cycle for each subsequent instruction in the program until the program is complete.

## Question 25

**De Morgan's Laws**: Prove De Morgan’s first law using a truth table.

### Question 25 Answer

De Morgan's first law states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of the complements of the sets. In boolean algebra, this law can be expressed as:

\( \overline{A + B} = \overline{A} \cdot \overline{B} \)

To prove De Morgan's first law using a truth table, we can construct truth tables for both sides of the equation and show that they are equivalent:

| A | B | A + B | $\overline{A + B}$ | $\overline{A}$ | $\overline{B}$ | $\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}$ |
|---|---|-------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     | 1                  | 1              | 1              | 1                                 |
| 0 | 1 | 1     | 0                  | 1              | 0              | 0                                 |
| 1 | 0 | 1     | 0                  | 0              | 1              | 0                                 |
| 1 | 1 | 1     | 0                  | 0              | 0              | 0                                 |

Certainly! Here are 10 additional multiple-choice questions across various topics relevant to your module:

## Question 51

**Sequential Logic**: What is the primary function of a D flip-flop?

- A. To store a single bit of data
- B. To perform arithmetic operations
- C. To synchronize signals
- D. To generate clock signals

### Question 51 Answer

**A. To store a single bit of data**  

The primary function of a D flip-flop is to store and transfer data in digital circuits. It acts as a one-bit memory element. The D flip-flop captures the value of the data input (D) on the edge of the clock signal and holds that value steady at its output (Q) until the next clock edge.

Here’s a breakdown of its main functions:

1. **Data Storage**: The D flip-flop stores the value of the data input (D) at the moment of the clock edge and retains this value until the next clock edge. This makes it a fundamental building block for memory elements in digital systems.

2. **Data Transfer**: It transfers the value from the data input (D) to the output (Q) on the clock edge. This ensures synchronized data transfer in sequential circuits.

3. **Edge-Triggered Operation**: The D flip-flop is edge-triggered, meaning it updates its output (Q) only on a specific edge of the clock signal, usually the rising edge or falling edge. This synchronization helps in creating precise timing in digital circuits.

### Basic Operation
- **D (Data)**: The input where the data is provided.
- **Clock (CLK)**: The control signal that triggers the transfer of data.
- **Q**: The output that reflects the stored data.
- **Q' (Not Q)**: The complement of the output.

### Truth Table

Here is the truth table for a positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop:

| **D** | **Clock Edge** | **Q(t)** | **Q(t+1)** |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------|
|   0   |    Rising      |    Q(t)  |     0      |
|   1   |    Rising      |    Q(t)  |     1      |

### Explanation:
- When the clock signal experiences a rising edge, the value of D is transferred to Q.
- **Q(t)** represents the current output before the clock edge.
- **Q(t+1)** represents the output after the clock edge, which matches the value of D at that moment.

In summary, the D flip-flop is crucial for data storage and synchronization in digital circuits, ensuring that data is captured and held accurately in relation to clock signals.

## Question 52

**Boolean Laws**: Which of the following expressions represents the Distributive Law in Boolean algebra?

1. \( A \cdot (B + C) = (A \cdot B) + (A \cdot C) \)

1. \( A \cdot B + C = (A \cdot B) + C \)
1. \( A + B \cdot C = (A + B) \cdot (A + C) \)

### Question 52 Answer

The Distributive Law in Boolean algebra states that the product of a variable with the sum of two other variables is equal to the sum of the products of the variable with each of the other variables individually. The correct expression representing the Distributive Law is:
